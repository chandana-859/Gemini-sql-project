INTELLIGENT SQL QUERYING USING LLMs (Gemini Pro)
Submission Date: February 2026
ABSTRACT
This project presents an Intelligent SQL Querying System powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using Gemini Pro. The system enables users to query relational databases using natural language instead of writing SQL commands manually. The model converts user questions into structured SQL queries, validates them, and executes them securely on the database. This improves accessibility, reduces technical barriers, and enhances productivity.

1. Introduction
Databases require structured SQL queries to retrieve information. Many users lack SQL expertise. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini Pro enable natural language understanding and code generation, bridging the gap between human language and structured query systems.
2. Literature Review
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based models have enabled Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Research shows schema-aware prompting improves accuracy in SQL generation.
3. Problem Statement
Non-technical users face challenges writing SQL queries. There is a need for an intelligent system that converts natural language into accurate and secure SQL queries.
4. Objectives
• Develop NL-to-SQL system using Gemini Pro.
• Ensure secure query validation.
• Improve query accuracy.
• Provide real-time database results.
5. Existing System
Traditional systems require manual SQL writing and technical expertise. They are time-consuming and error-prone.
6. Proposed System
The system accepts user input in natural language, sends structured prompts to Gemini Pro, receives SQL queries, validates them, executes safely, and displays results.
7. System Architecture
User → Frontend Interface → Python Backend → Gemini Pro API → SQL Database.
8. Methodology
Step 1: Database Setup
Step 2: Schema Extraction
Step 3: Prompt Engineering
Step 4: Query Validation
Step 5: Execution and Result Display.
9. Implementation
Technologies Used:
• Python
• MySQL
• Gemini Pro API
• Flask/Streamlit

The backend communicates with the Gemini API to generate SQL queries dynamically.
10. Testing
Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Prompt Accuracy Testing, and Security Testing were conducted to ensure system reliability.
11. Results
The system successfully converts natural language queries into SQL with high accuracy and executes them securely.
12. Limitations
Complex nested queries may reduce accuracy. Performance depends on API availability and schema clarity.
13. Future Enhancements
• Fine-tuned model training
• Multi-database support
• Voice-based input
• Role-based access control
14. Conclusion
The project demonstrates that LLM-powered systems can significantly improve database accessibility and usability through natural language interaction.
